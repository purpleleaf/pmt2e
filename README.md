# Poor  Man Tint2 Executors

A set of scripts to use as tint2 executors.

Forked from [t2ec](https://github.com/nwg-piotr), pmt2e is written with these purposes:

  * substitution of zenity with yad

  * add use of font glyphs beside text and icons output

  * remove  the use of a single  scripts to invoke all the others
; this choice in my opinion simplifies  the use of the scripts reducing the  number of options

  * porting python scripts to shell scripts

  * use OpenMeteo instead of OpenWeatherMaps

  * use separate name for exery tint2 executor instead of grouping all executors under  a single script calling  them (work in progress).

Many scripts show no changes related to the t2ec ones, excluding font glyphs, others are more  deeply modified and/or rewritten. Many other code snippets taken from other projects are used and credits are reported in every script description.
